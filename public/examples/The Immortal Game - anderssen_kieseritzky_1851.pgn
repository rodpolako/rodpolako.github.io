{ The Immortal Game was a chess game played in 1851 between Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky during the London 1851 chess tournament, an event in which both players participated. It was itself a casual game, however, not played as part of the tournament. Anderssen won the game by sacrificing all of his major pieces while developing a mating attack with his remaining minor pieces. Despite losing the game, Kieseritzky was impressed with Anderssen's performance. Kieseritzky published the game shortly thereafer in La Régence, a French chess journal which he helped to edit. Ernst Falkbeer published an analysis of the game in 1855, describing it for the first time with its sobriquet "immortal".

1. e4 e5 2. f4 { This is the King's Gambit: Anderssen offers his pawn in exchange for faster development. This was one of the most popular openings of the 19th century and is still occasionally seen, though defensive techniques have improved since Anderssen's time. } 2... exf4 3. Bc4 { The Bishop's Gambit; this line allows <b>3...Qh4+</b>, depriving White of the right to castle, and is less popular than <b>3.Nf3</b>. This check, however, also exposes Black's queen to attack with a gain of tempo on the eventual <b>Ng1–f3</b>. } 3... Qh4+ { [%cal Rh4e1,Bg1f3,Bf3h4] } 4. Kf1 b5?! { This is the Bryan Countergambit, deeply analysed by Kieseritzky, and which sometimes bears his name. It is not considered a sound move by most players today. } 5. Bxb5 Nf6 6. Nf3 { This is a common developing move, but in addition the knight attacks Black's queen, forcing Black to move it instead of developing his other pieces. } 6... Qh6 7. d3 { With this move, White solidifies control of the critical centre of the board. German grandmaster Robert Hübner recommends <b>7.Nc3</b> instead. } { [%cal Bb1c3] } 7... Nh5 { This move threatens <b>...Ng3+</b>, and protects the pawn on f4, but also sidelines the knight to a poor position at the edge of the board, where knights are the least powerful, and does not develop a new piece. } { [%csl Rg3][%cal Rh5g3,Rg3f1,Rg3h1] } 8. Nh4 { [%cal Rg7g6] } 8... Qg5 { Better was <b>8...g6</b>, according to Kieseritzky. } 9. Nf5 c6 { This simultaneously unpins the queen pawn and attacks the bishop. Modern chess engines suggest <b>9...g6</b> would be better, to deal with a very troublesome knight. } { [%cal Rg7g6] } 10. g4? Nf6 11. Rg1! { This is an advantageous passive piece sacrifice. If Black accepts, his queen will be boxed in, giving White a lead in development. } 11... cxb5? { Hübner believes this was Black's critical mistake; this gains material but lacks in development, at a point where White's strong development is able to quickly mount an offensive. Hübner recommends <b>11...h5</b> instead. } { [%cal Rh7h5] } 12. h4! { White's knight at f5 protects the pawn, which attacks Black's queen. } 12... Qg6 13. h5 Qg5 14. Qf3 { White now has two threats: 
<ul><li><b>Bxf4</b>, trapping Black's queen (the queen having no safe place to go);</li><li><b>e5</b>, attacking Black's knight at f6 while simultaneously exposing an attack by White's queen on the unprotected black rook on a8.</li></ul> } { [%cal Bc1f4,Be4e5] } 14... Ng8 { This deals with the threats, but undevelops Black even further—now the only black piece not on its starting square is the queen, which is about to be put on the run, while White has control over a great deal of the board. } 15. Bxf4 Qf6 16. Nc3 Bc5 { An ordinary developing move by Black, which also attacks the rook at g1. } 17. Nd5 { White responds to the attack with a counterattack. This move threatens the black queen and also <b>Nc7+</b>, forking the king and rook. Richard Réti recommends <b>17.d4</b> followed by <b>18.Nd5</b>, with advantage to White, although if <b>17.d4 Bf8</b> then <b>18.Be5</b> would be a stronger move. } { [%cal Rd5c7,Rc7e8,Rc7a8,Bd3d4,Bc3d5,Rc5f8,Bf4e5] } 17... Qxb2 { Black gains a pawn, and threatens to gain the rook on a1 with check. } 18. Bd6! { With this move White offers to sacrifice both of his rooks. Hübner comments that, from this position, there are actually many ways to win, and he believes there are at least three better moves than <b>18.Bd6</b>: <b>18.d4</b>, <b>18.Be3</b>, or <b>18.Re1</b>, which lead to strong positions or checkmate without needing to sacrifice so much material. The <i>Chessmaster</i> computer program annotation says "the main point [of 18. Bd6] is to divert the black queen from the a1–h8 diagonal. Now Black cannot play <b>18...Bxd6? 19.Nxd6+ Kd8 20.Nxf7+ Ke8 21.Nd6+ Kd8 22.Qf8#</b>." Garry Kasparov comments that the world of chess would have lost one of its "crown jewels" if the game had continued in such an unspectacular fashion. <b>18. Bd6!</b> is surprising, because White is willing to give up so much material. } 18... Bxg1? { Wilhelm Steinitz suggested in 1879 that a better move would be <b>18...Qxa1+</b>; likely moves to follow are <b>19.Ke2 Qb2 20.Kd2 Bxg1</b>. The continuation played is still winning for White, however, despite having many complications. The variation continues <b>21.e5! Ba6 22.Bb4! Qxe5 (22...Be3+ 23.Qxe3 +/−; 22...Nh6 23.Nd6+ Kf8 24.g5 +−) 23.Nd6+ Qxd6 24.Bxd6 +/−</b>. } { [%csl Rb1][%cal Rb2a1,Ra1f1,Gf1e2,Ge2d2] } 19. e5! { This sacrifices yet another white rook. More importantly, this move blocks the queen from participating in the defense of the king, and threatens mate in two: <b>20.Nxg7+ Kd8 21.Bc7#</b>. } { [%csl Gc7,Ge8][%cal Gf5g7,Gg7e8,Re8d8,Gd6e7] } 19... Qxa1+ 20. Ke2 { At this point, Black's attack has run out of steam; Black has a queen and bishop on White's back rank, but cannot effectively mount an immediate attack on White, while White can storm forward. According to Kieseritzky, he resigned at this point. Hübner notes that an article by Friedrich Amelung in the journal Baltische Schachblaetter, 1893, reported that Kiesertizky probably played <b>20...Na6</b>, but Anderssen then announced the mating moves. The Oxford Companion to Chess also says that Black resigned at this point, citing an 1851 publication. In any case, it is suspected that the last few moves were not actually played on the board in the original game. } 20... Na6 { The black knight covers c7 as White was threatening <b>21.Nxg7+ Kd8 22.Bc7#</b>. Another attempt to defend is <b>20...Ba6</b>, allowing the black king to flee via c8 and b7, although White has enough with the continuation <b>21.Nc7+ Kd8</b> and <b>22.Nxa6</b>, where if now <b>22...Qxa2</b> (to defend f7 against <b>Bc7+</b>, <b>Nd6+</b> and <b>Qxf7#</b>) White can play <b>23.Bc7+ Ke8 24.Nb4</b>, winning; or, if <b>22...Bb6</b> (stopping <b>Bc7+</b>), <b>23.Qxa8 Qc3 24.Qxb8+ Qc8 25.Qxc8+ Kxc8 26.Bf8 h6 27.Nd6+ Kd8 28.Nxf7+ Ke8 29.Nxh8 Kxf8</b>, with a winning endgame for White. } { [%cal Ra6c7,Gd5c7] } 21. Nxg7+ Kd8 22. Qf6+! { This queen sacrifice forces Black to give up his defense of e7. } 22... Nxf6 23. Be7# { At the end, Black is ahead in material by a considerable margin: a queen, two rooks, and a bishop. But the material does not help Black. White has been able to use his remaining pieces—two knights and a bishop—to force mate. } 1-0
