# Changes in this version:

* Added sound effects (move, capture, check, checkmate, and error).  By default these are turned off to prevent distraction but can be enabled in the Settings menu
* **Experimental** - Added text to speech to have the computer say the moves.  It currently has an issue due to the speed of the computer moves where your move won't get said since the computer plays the next move immediately and that will cancel the first speech and start the next one.  The net result is that you only hear the computer's moves.  Works fine when playing both sides since there is time to speak the words between moves.  By default it is also disabled.
* Minor fix to the color pickers which would behave weird when trying to type in a color value instead of using the wheel or copy/pasting in the value.
* Minor UI fixes/updates
* Code cleanup and refactoring. More to come as part of a future major update.
