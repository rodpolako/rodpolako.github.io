{ The Opera Game was a chess game played in 1858 at an opera house in Paris. The American master Paul Morphy played against two amateurs: the German noble Karl II, Duke of Brunswick, and the French aristocrat Comte Isouard de Vauvenargues. It was played as a consultation game, with Duke Karl and Count Isouard jointly deciding each move for the black pieces, while Morphy controlled the white pieces by himself. The game was played in a box while an opera was performed on stage. Morphy quickly checkmated his opponents following rapid development and sacrifice of material, including a queen sacrifice.

It is among the most famous of chess games. The game is often used by chess instructors to teach the importance of piece development, the value of sacrifices in mating combinations, and other concepts.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 { This is Philidor's Defence, named after François-André Danican Philidor, the leading chess master of the second half of the 18th century and a pioneer of modern chess strategy. He was also a noted opera composer. It is a solid opening, but slightly passive, and it ignores the important d4-square. Most modern players prefer <b>2...Nc6</b> or <b>2...Nf6</b>, Petrov's Defence. } { [%cal Gd6e5] } 3. d4 { [%cal Gd4e5,Rd6e5] } 3... Bg4?! { Though common at the time, <b>3...Bg4 </b> is now considered inferior. Bobby Fischer, in his analysis of the game, called it a weak move. Today <b>3...exd4</b> or <b>3...Nf6</b> are more commonly played. Philidor's original idea, <b>3...f5</b>, is a risky alternative. } 4. dxe5 Bxf3 { If <b>4...dxe5</b>, then <b>5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Nxe5</b> and White wins a pawn and Black has lost the ability to castle, and White is threatening <b>Nxf7+</b> winning the rook. If <b>4...Qe7</b>, White remains a pawn up with <b>5.Qd5</b>. Black, however, did have the option of <b>4...Nd7 5.exd6 Bxd6</b>. In this position, Black is down a pawn but has some compensation in the form of better development. } { [%cal Gg2f3,Gd1f3] } 5. Qxf3 { Steinitz's recommendation <b>5.gxf3 dxe5 6.Qxd8+ Kxd8 7.f4</b> is also good, but Morphy prefers to keep the queens on. After Black recaptures the pawn on e5, White has a significant lead in development. A recapture with the queen is the most natural as it keeps a healthy kingside pawn structure. } 5... dxe5 { [%cal Rd8d1] } 6. Bc4 Nf6? { This seemingly sound developing move runs into a surprising refutation. After White's next move, both f7 and b7 will be under attack. Better would have been to directly protect the f7-pawn with <b>6...Qd7</b> or <b>6...Qf6</b>, making White's next move less potent. } { [%cal Rf6e4,Rf6d5] } 7. Qb3 Qe7 { Black's only reasonable move. White was threatening mate in two, for example, <b>7...Nc6 8.Bxf7+ Ke7</b> (or <b>Kd7</b>) <b>9.Qe6#</b>. <b>7...Qd7</b> loses the rook to <b>8.Qxb7</b> followed by <b>9.Qxa8</b> (since <b>8...Qc6?</b> would lose the queen to <b>9.Bb5</b>). 
Although this move prevents immediate disaster, Black blocks the f8-bishop, impeding development and kingside castling. } 8. Nc3 { Morphy could have won a pawn by <b>8.Qxb7 Qb4+ 9.Qxb4 Bxb4+</b>. White can also win more material with <b>8.Bxf7+ Qxf7 9.Qxb7</b>, but Black has dangerous counterplay after <b>9...Bc5!</b> and <b>10.Qxa8 0-0</b>, or <b>10.Qc8+ Ke7 11.Qxh8 Bxf2+!</b>. "But that would have been a butcher’s method, not an artist's." (Lasker). In keeping with his style, Morphy prefers rapid development and initiative over material. } 8... c6 { The best move, allowing Black to defend his pawn while strengthening the light squares, which have already been weakened by Black trading off his light-square bishop. } { [%csl Rf6,Re7] } 9. Bg5 b5? { Black attempts to drive away the bishop and gain some time, but this move allows Morphy a strong sacrifice to keep the initiative. This move loses but it is difficult to find anything better; for example <b>9...Na6 10.Bxf6 gxf6 11.Bxa6 bxa6 12.Qa4 Qb7</b> and Black's position is very weak. } { [%cal Bc4b5,Bc3b5,Bb3b5] } 10. Nxb5! { Morphy chooses not to retreat the bishop, which would allow Black to gain time for development. } 10... cxb5 { Black could have prolonged the game by playing <b>10...Qb4+</b>, forcing the exchange of queens, but White wins comfortably after either <b>11.Nc3</b> or <b>11.Qxb4 Bxb4+ 12.c3!</b> } 11. Bxb5+ { Not <b>11.Bd5? Qb4+</b>, unpinning the knight and allowing the rook to evade capture. } 11... Nbd7 { <b>11...Kd8</b> holds out longer, but <b>12.O-O-O+</b> still gives White a winning attack. } 12. O-O-O Rd8 { The combination of the pins on the knights and the open file for White's rook will lead to Black's defeat. } 13. Rxd7 Rxd7 { Removing another defender. } 14. Rd1 { White's piece activity is in marked contrast to Black's passivity. Black's d7-rook cannot be saved, since it is pinned to the king by the bishop and attacked by the rook, and though the knight defends it, the knight is pinned to the queen. } 14... Qe6 { <b>Qe6</b> is a futile attempt to unpin the knight (allowing it to defend the rook) and offer a queen trade, to take some pressure out of the white attack. Even if Morphy did not play his next crushing move, he could have always traded his bishop for the knight, followed by winning the rook. } 15. Bxd7+ Nxd7 { If <b>15...Qxd7</b>, then <b>16.Qb8+ Ke7 17.Qxe5+ Kd8 18.Bxf6+ gxf6 19.Qxf6+ Kc8 20.Rxd7 Kxd7 21.Qxh8</b> and White is clearly winning. Moving the king leads to mate: <b>15...Ke7 16.Qb4+ Qd6</b> (<b>16...Kd8 17.Qb8+ Ke7 18.Qe8#</b>) <b>17.Qxd6+ Kd8 18.Qb8+ Ke7 19.Qe8#</b> or <b>15...Kd8 16.Qb8+ Ke7 17.Qe8#</b>. } 16. Qb8+! { Morphy finishes with a queen sacrifice. } 16... Nxb8 17. Rd8# { 1-0 White wins. } 1-0
